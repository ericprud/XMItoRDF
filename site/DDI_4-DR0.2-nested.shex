Two InstanceVariables of a person's height reference the same RepresentedVariable. This indicates that they are intended to: be measured with the same unit of measurement, have the same intended data type, have the same SubstantativeValueDomain, use a SentinelValueDomain drawn from the same set of SentinelValueDomains, have the same sentinel (missing value) concepts, and draw their Population from the same Universe. In other words, the two InstanceVariables should be comparable.

Explanatory notes
===================
The InstanceVariable class inherits all of the properties and relationships of the RepresentedVariable (RV) class and, in turn, the ConceptualVariable (CV) class. This means that an InstanceVariable can be completely populated without the need to create an associated RepresentedVariable or ConceptualVariable. If, however, a user wishes to indicate that a particular InstanceVariable is patterned after a particular RepresentedVariable or a particular ConceptualVariable that may be indicated by including a relationship to the RV and or CV. Including these references is an important method of indicating that multiple InstanceVariables have the same representation, measure the same concept, and are drawn from the same Universe. If two InstanceVariables of a person's height reference the same RepresentedVariable.

An enumeration of concepts for a categorical variable like \"male\" and \"female\" for gender.

Explanatory notes
===================
A ConceptualVariable links a UnitType to a SubstantiveConceptualDomain. The latter can be an enumeration or description of the values (Signified) that the variable may take on. In the enumerated case these are the categories in a CategorySet that can be values, not the codes that represent the values. 
An example might be the conceptual domain for a variable representing self-identified gender. An enumeration might include the concept of “male” and the concept of “female”. These, in turn, would be represented in a SubstantiveValueDomain by codes in a CodeList like “m” and “f”, or “0” and “1”. 
A conceptual domain might be described through a ValueAndConceptDescription’s description property of “a real number greater than 0” or through a more formal logicalExpression of “(all reals x such that x >0) “. Even in the described case, what is being described are conceptual, not the symbols used to represent the values.

Explanatory notes
===================
In a traditional data table each column might represent some variable (measurement). Each row would represent the entity (Unit)  to which those variables relate. Height measurements might be made on persons (UnitType) of primary school age (Universe) at Pinckney Elementary School on September 1, 2005 (Population). The height for Mary Roe (Unit)  might be 139 cm.
The Unit is not invariably tied to some value. A median income might be calculated for a block in the U.S. but then used as an attribute of a person residing on that block. For the initial measurement the Unit was the block. In the reuse the unit would be that specific person to which the value was applied.
In a big data table each row represents a unit/variable double. Together a unit identifier and a variable identifier define the key. And for each key there is just one value – the measure of the unit  on the variable. 
A big data table is sometimes referred to as a column-oriented data store whereas a traditional database is sometimes referred to as a row-oriented data store. The unit plays an identifier role in both types of data stores.

Explanatory notes
===================
UnitType is the most general in the hierarchy of UnitType, Universe, and Population. It is a description of the basic characteristic for a general set of Units.  A Universe is a set of entities defined by a more narrow specification than that of an underlying UnitType. A Population further narrows the specification to a specific time and geography.
A Unit Type is used to describe a class or group of Units based on a single characteristic with no specification of time and geography.  For example, the Unit Type of “Person” groups together a set of Units based on the characteristic that they are ‘Persons’.
It concerns not only Unit Types used in dissemination, but anywhere in the statistical process. E.g. using administrative data might involve the use of a fiscal unit. [GSIM 1.1]

Universe sits in a hierarchy between UnitType and Population, with UnitType being most general and Population most specific. A Universe is a set of entities defined by a more narrow specification than that of an underlying UnitType. A Population further narrows the specification to a specific time and geography.

If the Universe consists of people, a number of factors may be used in defining membership in the Universe, such as age, sex, race, residence, income, veteran status, criminal convictions, etc. The universe may consist of elements other than persons, such as housing units, court cases, deaths, countries, etc. A universe may be described as \"inclusive\" or \"exclusive\".

Explanatory notes
===================
This would most commonly be used in a Codebook along with an AlgorithmOverview and a DesignOverview. Note that Process may be described in more detail than a high level overview.
Note that the algorithm may be implemented by multiple processes which are not limited to any specific type of Process. This can be constrained by the inclusion of only specific realizations of Process within a Functional View. Note that this MethodologyOverview can be used as a collective description of specific methodologies used by a Study or other broad set of metadata."""^^mark:

============
A specific geographic unit of a defined Unit Type. A geographic unit may change its name, composition, or geographic extent over time. This may be tracked by versioning the content of the geographic unit. Normally a new version of a geographic unit would have a geographic (spatial) overlap with its previous version (a city annexing new area). A geographic unit ends when it is no longer a unit of the same unit type.

Examples
==========
The State of Minnesota from 1858 to date where the Unit Type is a State as defined by the United States Census Bureau. It has a geographic extent and supersedes a portion of the Territory of Minnesota and a portion of the Territory of Wisconsin. Minnesota territory had both a broader geographic extent, different Unit Type, and earlier time period (1849-1858) as did the Territory of Wisconsin.

Explanatory notes
===================
An InstanceVariable has details of value domain and datatype, but will not have the final details of how a value is physically represented in a data file. A variable for height, for example, may be represented as a real number, but may be represented as a string in multiple ways. The decimal separator might be, for example a period or a comma. The string representing the value of a payment might be preceded by a currency symbol. The same numeric value might be written as “1,234,567” or “1.234567 E6”. A missing value might be written as “.”, “NA”, “.R” or as “R”. 
The ValueMapping describes how the value of an InstanceVariable is physically expressed. The properties of the ValueMapping as intended to be compatible with the W3C Metadata Vocabulary for Tabular Data (https://www.w3.org/TR/tabular-metadata/ ) as well as common programming languages and statistical packages. The “format” property, for example can draw from an external controlled vocabulary such as the set of formats for Stata, SPSS, or SAS."""^^mark:

============
Provides the details of the process used to apply the sampling design and obtain the sample. Sampling Process contains a Workflow Step which provides the constituents of a Workflow. It can be a composition (a set of Control Constructs) or atomic (an Act) and may be performed by a service. This allows the use of existing Workflow models to express various sampling process actions. Sampling Frames and Sample Population can be used as designated Inputs or Outputs using Parameters.

Examples
==========
A Split which takes a sampling stage and divides the sample frame into different subsets. A different sampling technique is applied to each subset. Once a split occurs each subset can have stages underneath, and the number of states under each split subset may differ.
A Stage is the application of a single sampling algorithm applied to a sampling frame. For instance, the US Current Population Survey samples geographic areas first before identifying household to contact within each of those areas.
A Stratification of a stage into multiple subsets. Each stratified group will be sampled using the same sampling approach. For example stratifying a state by ZIP Code areas in each of 5 mean income quintiles and then doing a random sample of the households in a set of Zip Codes. Allows for oversampling of identified subpopulations."""^^mark:

In a study where the study is a wave in a StudySeries, we do a single traversal of the Generic Longitudinal Business Process Model. From one wave to the next the traversal may be different. Each traversal is described in a DataPipeline.

Extract Transform and Load (ETL) platforms support data pipelines to move data between systems. Using an ETL platform, data engineers create data pipelines to orchestrate the movement, transformation, validation, and loading of data, from source to final destination. The DataPipeline describes this \"orchestration\".

A prospective DataPipeline gives guidance to data engineers. It is a design pattern. A retrospective DataPipeline documents an ETL data pipeline after the fact.

ExternalMaterial is used to identify material and optionally specific sections of the material that have a relationship to a class. There is a generic relatedMaterial on AnnotatedIdentifiable. This should be used to attach any additional material that the user identifies as important to the class. The properties typeOfMaterial, descriptiveText, and relationshipDescription should be used to clarify the purpose and coverage of the related material.

Explanatory notes
===================
Within the DDI model, ExternalMaterial is used as an extension base for specific external materials found such as an External Aid. It is used as a base for specifically related material (e.g. ExternalAid) by creating a relationship whose name clarifies the purpose of the related material.

============
MetadataDrivenActions are Acts in which their logic is defined by validation and transformation rules expressed in some standard rule language.

Examples
==========
Some data management systems present users with a menu of actions they can use in a sequence to perform a specific task. The system engages the user in a dialog driven by an action template. The dialog completes the template which the system then uses to perform the action. The user doesn't write any code.

Explanatory notes
===================
Whereas ComputationActions are used in statistical packages like SPSS, Stata, SAS and R to perform data management and data transformations, MetadataDrivenActions are used by data pipelines, e.g. ETL (Extract Transform Load) platforms, along with ComputationActions.

In a data pipeline the user is presented with a menu of MetadataDrivenActions that are captured here in an external controlled vocabulary. Users enter into a dialog with the platform through which they customize the MetadataDrivenAction. The user writes no code. The dialog is saved.

In the course of this dialog the user might specify a data source, specify which variables to keep or drop, rename variables, specify join specifics, create a value map between two variables and so forth.

MetadataDrivenActions represent this dialog in some standard rule language, e.g. Structured Data Transformation Language (SDTL) , Validation and Transformation Language (VTL), etc.. In fact,  MetaDataDrivenAction can use VTL with certain \"extensions\". Together they form quasi-VTL. quasi-VTL in turn conforms to a known schema. Using this schema users can render the quasi-VTL as XHTML and record it in the MetadataDrivenAction quasiVTL property. quasiVTL supports structured text.

Note that we would like NOT to create specific subtypes of MetadataDrivenAction -- one for each transformation. In fact there are a dozen or more such actions that will be captured in the MetadataDrivenAction types external controlled vocabulary. As an alternative, users can optionally write structured text based on a known schema. In this approach we are able to \"evolve\" SDTL as needed without changing our model. Instead, as our language \"evolves\", we one have to update its schema."""^^mark:

A computation action may be expecting a numeric array of values [result of looping an \"Age in years\" question through every member of a household]. isArray = \"true\"; valueRepresentation would link to a SubstantiveValueDomain defining a numeric value with a possible valid range; and because the parameter occurs in the context of a computation action it is necessary to specify an alias (e.g. AGE).

A RepeatUntil loop is similar to a RepeatWhile loop, except that it tests the Boolean expression after the loop rather than before. Thus, a RepeatUntil loop always executes the loop once, whereas if the Boolean expression is initially False, a RepeatWhile loop does not execute the loop at all. For example, in a household there is at last one person and a loop might contain a block of person questions.

============
A description of spatial coverage (geographic coverage) of the annotated object. Spatial coverage is described using a number of objects that support searching by a wide range of systems (geospatial coordinates, geographic classification systems, and general systems using dcterms:spatial).

Examples
==========
A country, a neighborhood, the inside of a polygon on the surface of the earth, along a street, at a particular intersection, or perhaps even in a certain orbit around the planet Mars. For a data set within a study this may be used to define the geographic restriction of the data set within the geographic coverage of the study (eg. The study may cover all of Sweden but the spatial coverage of the data set is Stockholm). 

Explanatory notes
===================
Different systems support different approaches to descriptions of geographic or spatial coverage. Dublin Core has a descriptive text field that is the equivalent of SpatialCoverage/description. Geographers need to understand the spatial objects available (spatialObject, highest and lowest level geography, geographic units and unit types) so they know the building blocks they have to create a map. Spatial search engines do a first pass search by a simple bounding box (the north and south latitudes and east and west longitudes that define the spatial coverage area). Spatial Coverage provides basic support for all of these uses.

============
A DataStoreLibrary is a collection or, again, a \"library\" of DataStores.

An individual DataStore is associated with a Study. A collection of DataStores is associated with a StudySeries.

The relationships among the DataStores in the DataStoreLibrary is described by the DataStoreRelationStructure. Relations may be more or less complicated depending on the StudySeries type. A StudySeries may be ad hoc. A StudySeries may form a time series. The variety of these collections has been described using the <a href=https://www.ddialliance.org/Specification/DDI-Lifecycle/3.1/XMLSchema/FieldLevelDocumentation/\">\"Group\"</a> in DDI 3.1.

Like any RelationStructure, the DataStoreRelationStructure is able to describe both part/whole relations and generalization/specialization relations. See the controlled vocabulary at <a href=\"http://lion.ddialliance.org/datatypes/relationspecification\">RelationSpecification</a> to review all the types of relations a RelationStructure is able to describe. 

Examples
==========
A StudySeries is a time series and a DataStoreRelationStructure is dedicated to tracking \"supplements\".

There is a study at T0. Perhaps it is never executed. It is the \"core\" study. At T1 there is a study that includes the core and Supplement A. At T2 there is a study that includes the core, Supplement A and Supplement B. At T3 there is a study that includes the core and a one off supplement that is never asked again. T4 though T6 repeats T1 through T3.



Explanatory notes
===================
If we broke a study down into sub-studies where the core is a sub-study and each supplement is a sub-study, we could also use the DataStoreRelationStructure to track the generalization/specialization relationship or, again, \"going deep\" over time.

Sometimes across a StudySeries we add panels. If panels were also sub-studies, we could use the DataStoreRelationStructure to track both the core and supplements by panel over time.

============
The LogicalRecord is a record definition. It is abstract.

The actual realization of record definitions are provided by the UnitDataRecord and the DataCube. UnitDataRecords support two types of record definitions. The first is based on the SimpleCollection it inherits from LogicalRecord. The second type is a StructuredCollection that specializes the LogicalRecord. As a SimpleCollection a UnitDataRecord can, for example, provide table definitions. As a StructuredCollection, UnitDataRecord can define structures comparable to a \"struct\" in C or a JSON nested object. A UnitDataRecord, then, inherits SimpleCollection from LogicalRecord but adds its own StructuredCollection into the mix. The DataCube brings into play its own StructuredCollection which is distinct from the UnitDataRecord StructuredCollection.The DataCube StructuredCollection is not currently in scope.

The various record definitions -- simple and structured -- when they are actually instantiated with data is described by the PhysicalLayout of a LogicalRecord in the FormatDescription package. The PhysicalLayout places data into DataPoints formed at the direction of a LogicalRecord and its instance variables. At this point a LogicalRecord turn into a \"dataset\" that hosts unit records, A record definition is not a record. So we conflate metadata and data when we refer to a LogicalRecord as an empty table.

Examples
==========
SQL Data Definition Language (DDL) traffics in record definitions. SQL queries on \"system tables\" discover record definitions.

Explanatory notes
===================
In GSIM a DataPoint is a member of a \"DataSet\" and a UnitDataRecord. Since a DataPoint contains \"Datum\", this can lead to the conflation of a DataSet and a record definition. In the presence of a DataPoint it is difficult to be clear that a record definition does not have any rows. 

In DDI4 we defer the introduction of DataPoints until PhysicalLayouts are described. In this approach the instance variables that make up a LogicalRecord work downstream where they help to give each DataPoint in a PhysicalRecord its format.

A type of Designation that relates a representation expressed as a string with or without meaningful white space to a specific classification. For use in a Code List. The representation property (Value) is expressed as it would be found in a data file. Multiple representations may relate to the same Category but should be expressed as separate Codes.

The letter M might stand for the category Male in the CodeList called Gender.

Explanatory notes
===================
A Code is a kind of Designation, in particular it is the assignment of an alphanumeric string to stand in place of a category. 

It should not be confused with a ClassificationItem which is a placeholder for a position in a StatisticalClassification. It contains a Designation, for which Code is a kind; a Category; and other things. For example, in 2012 NAICS (North American Industry Classification System) one Classification Item has the Code 23 and the Category construction.

ISCO-08 (Major, Sub-Major, and Minor) or NAICS (2 digit sector codes, 3 digit subsector code list, 4 digit industry group code list, and 5 digit industry code list)


Explanatory notes
===================
Levels are used to organize a hierarchy. Usually, a hierarchy often contains one root member at the top, though it could contain several. These are the first Level. All members directly related to those  in the first Level compose the second Level. The third and subsequent Levels are defined similarly. 

A Level often is associated with a Concept, which defines it. These correspond to kinds of aggregates. For example, in the US Standard Occupational Classification (2010), the Level below the top is called Major Occupation Groups, and the next Level is called Minor Occupational Groups. These ideas convey the structure. In particular, Health Care Practitioners (a Major Group) can be broken into Chiropractors, Dentists, Physicians, Vets, Therapists, etc. (Minor Groups) The Categories in the Nodes at the lower Level aggregate to the Category in Node above them.

\"Classification schemes are frequently organized in nested levels of increasing detail. ISCO-08, for example, has four levels: at the top level are ten major groups, each of which contain sub-major groups, which in turn are subdivided in minor groups, which contain unit groups. Even when a classification is not structured in levels (\"flat classification\"), the usual convention, which is adopted here, is to consider that it contains one unique level.\" (http://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/xkos.html#) Individual classification items organized in a hierarchy may be associated with a specific level.

The Value Domain for a sentinel conceptual domain. Sentinel values are defined in ISO 11404 as
\"element of a value space that is not completely consistent with a datatype's properties and characterizing operations...\". A common example would be codes for missing values.

Examples
==========
Missing categories expressed as Codes <-9, refused>; <-8, Don't Know> for a numeric variable with values greater than zero.  

Explanatory notes
===================
Sentinel values are used for processing, not to describe subject matter. Typical examples include missing values or invalid entry codes. Sentinel Value Domains are typically of the enumerated type, but they can be the described type, too.

This is not to say that sentinel values carry no information. Data on gender might be enumerated by \"0, male\" and \"1, female\". These are the substantive values (see Substantive Value Domain). However, there may be the need to include missing values along with that data, such as \"m, missing\" and \"r, refused\". These are sentinel values.

ISO/IEC 11404 - General purpose datatypes, defines sentinel values in terms of how that standard defines datatypes. But, the fact that the sentinels don't fit in terms of the calculations and statistics one would perform on the \"clean\" data is a distinguishing characteristic. In the example above, one would not include missing or refused data in calculating a ratio of females to the total population.

Sentinel values may be described rather than enumerated. For instance, there might be a range of values, each representing an out of range value, but there could be too many to enumerate. It is easier to describe the range.

In some software missing values are represented as values not in the datatype of the valid values. R has values of NA, NaN, Inf, and -Inf. SAS and Stata have values displayed as \".\", \".A\" through \".Z\", and \"._\"

Other software might use values like 999 for missing that would otherwise be the same datatype as valid values but outside the parameters of the domain.

In the gender example above:
For SPSS the sentinel values might be represented as:
998 = \"refused\"
999 = \"not recorded\"

For SAS or Stata the sentinel values might be represented as:
.R = \"refused\"
.N = \"not recorded\"

Sentinel values can also be used for other purposes beyond missing. For a numeric variable \"A\" might represent a value somewhere in a defined range to prevent disclosure of information about an individual. This might be considered a \"semi-missing value\".
In SAS or Stata for example:
.A = \"greater than or equal to 100 and less than 1000 \"

Explanatory notes
===================
The ValueAndConceptDescription may be used to describe either a value domain or a conceptual domain. For a value domain, the ValueAndConceptDescription contains the details for a “described” domain (as opposed to an enumerated domain). There are a number of properties which can be used for the description. The description could be just text such as: “an even number greater than zero”. Or a more formal logical expression like “x>0 and mod(x,2)=0”. A regular expression might be useful for describing a textual domain. It could also employ a format pattern from the Unicode Locale Data Markup Language (LDML) (http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35.html.
Some Conceptual Domains might be described with just a narrative. Others, though, might be described in much the same way as a value domain depending on the specificity of the concept.

In ISO 11404 a value domain may be described either through enumeration or description, or both. This class provides the facility for that description. It may be just a text description, but a description through a logical expression is machine actionable and might, for example, be rendered as an integrity constraint. If both text and a logical expression are provided the logical expression is to be taken as the canonical description.
The logical expression should conform to the expression syntax of VTL. https://sdmx.org/?page_id=5096"""^^mark:
